Merry Christmas!  I'm so excited for this month because Christmas is my favorite holiday of the year.  I love Christmas not because of presents or Christmas treats but because of how it reminds me of Jesus' birth.  Every year, I am so blessed to remember how Jesus came to Earth as a baby to save me from my sin.  This year, I'm planning on going home to visit my friends and family and also help give food to people who are hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas here in California isn't that cold - it never snows here and doesn't rain too much.  Sometimes I wish there was snow so I could play in it but then I am thankful that I don't have to wear a lot of clothes to keep warm.  How is the Christmas weather like for you in Thailand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any Christmas plans coming up?  What do you usually do for Christmas?  And is Christmas a big holiday in Thailand or do you have one that you like better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you and your family are doing well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOVE!
Isaac&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
